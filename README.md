Exercise 3 on the Udemy "Sally has 3 dogs" exercise involves writing a C++ program that uses a function to output the message "Sally has 3 dogs" to the console. The code includes a function called sallys_dogs(), which initializes an integer variable x to 3. The code provided should not be modified.

The exercise requires the student to write the code that outputs the message to the console using the std::cout object and the integer variable x. This involves using the insertion operator "<<" to concatenate the string "Sally has " with the integer variable x and the string " dogs", then passing the resulting string to std::cout for output.

Overall, this exercise provides practice with writing functions and manipulating variables in C++, as well as using the std::cout object to output text to the console.
